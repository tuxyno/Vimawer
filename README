Vimawer is a simple image viewer tool written in Python.
My first idea, was a very simple program that can open main image
formats (jpg, png and gif), but, writing code on code, I'm adding 
some nice features.

== What Vimawer can actually do? ==
	* File/Image manage 
		* Open a lot of formats image.
		* Open a remote URL.
		* Save your images.
	* Quick edit of an image
		* Scale image plus, less, or exact size you want.
		* Rotate image of 90, 180, 270 grades.		
	* Explorer bar
		* Explore your local PC images.
		* Explore your recent images.
		* Explore your recent urls.
	* OTHER
		* Show/Hide Toolbar or Explorer bar
		* Fullscreen mode
		* NICE Slideshow mode! 
	* Plugins
		* Ask a confirm before close a tab containing an image.
		* Ask a confirm before close the app.
		* Get an image directly from your Webcam.
		* Get a shot of your screen (screenshot)
		* Open the current image with an external program
				
As you can see, the full power of this program is with the Plugins!
There are some plugins written by the author of Vimawer available, but you
can write a plugin and share with the others.
To have more info, see TestAll plugin in /Plugins directory.
I hope I will have time to work on this project very well and often, and, to
write a valid documentation on plugin apis.
Stay tuned :)

Davide.
