Vimawer is a simple image viewer tool written in Python.
My first idea, was a very simple program that can open main image
formats (jpg, png and gif), but, writing code on code, I'm adding 
some nice features.

== What 

The main power of this program are the Plugins!
There are some plugins written by the author of Vimawer available, but you
can write a plugin and share with the others.
To have more info, see TestAll plugin in /Plugins directory.
I hope I will have time to work on this project very well and often, and, to
write a valid documentation on plugin apis.
Stay tuned :)

Davide.
